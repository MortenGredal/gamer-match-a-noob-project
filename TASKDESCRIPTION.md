Backend - Coding Challenge

You are building a directory of gamers and their favorite games to auto match for a centralized app of all games.

    APIs to enroll gamers and their interest 

        Which takes the general details (name, gender, nickname, geography(europe,asia,usa))
        Lookup up Any 5 games(fortnite, call of duty, dota, valhalla, amongus,â€¦).
        Gamers individual interests with their levels (noob, pro, invincible)

    Search API based on gamers levels, games and geography for auto-matching
    API to give credits to individual users
    API to get the gamer with maximum credits for each game based on their levels.

Make sure you use a full REST API convention and that you return the correct error codes when necessary. If you posses the skills, using GraphQL endpoints is also an option.

We recommend that the services are written in JAVA, SPRING BOOT and built on MAVEN/GRADLE

At the root of the project there must be a README file describing the process to run and test the service and any challenges/decisions made during the process of developing this case study.

Additional information:

We expect you to spend 5-6 hours on this, the main purpose is to have some code from you to talk about, and for you to explain what and how you approached it.

    In-memory database can be used
    Design datamodels
    Validate input - watch out for any injection tries that an API user might insert
    API usage docs (Swagger, or whatever is preferred)
    Unit tests
    Make the repo public available for us to review, on GitHub
